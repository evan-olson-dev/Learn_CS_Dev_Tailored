## 7. Source Control with Git and GitLab

Modern development is collaborative, and your team uses **Git** with **GitLab** for version control and project management. Even if you have used Git minimally, it’s important to become fluent in common Git operations and understand the typical workflow on GitLab (especially regarding branches, merge requests, and issue tracking).

**Git Fundamentals:** Git is a *distributed version control system* – it tracks changes in your code and allows multiple developers to work simultaneously without overriding each other’s work ([What is Git - A Beginner's Guide to Git Version Control | DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/all-about-git#:~:text=Git%20is%20a%20distributed%20version,don%27t%20conflict%20with%20each%20other)). Key concepts to master:
- **Repository:** A Git repository is essentially your project’s tracked content (files and history). You’ll clone the repository from GitLab to your local machine to work on it.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of changes. You’ll make commits locally with clear messages describing *what* and *why* you changed something. Commit often to save incremental progress.
- **Branch:** A separate line of development. Your team likely uses branches for features or bug fixes (e.g., `feature/add-new-sensor` branch). The `main` (or `master`) branch is usually the stable integration branch. Learn to create, switch, and merge branches. Branching allows you to work on new features without disturbing the main code until it’s ready.
- **Merge (Pull) Request:** In GitLab, a *Merge Request (MR)* is how you propose merging your branch into another (usually into `main` or a release branch). It’s a central place for code **review, discussion, and tracking changes** ([Merge requests | GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/#:~:text=Merge%20requests%20provide%20a%20central,when%20the%20merge%20request%20merges)). You’ll push your branch to GitLab and open a MR. Team members (reviewers) will comment on the code, suggest changes, and eventually approve the MR. Once approved, it gets merged into the main codebase.
- **Conflicts:** Sometimes two changes conflict (e.g., you and someone else edited the same file). You’ll need to merge the latest main into your branch and resolve conflicts manually. It’s a common task – learn how to read conflict markers and test after merging.
- **Basic Commands:** Know how to `git clone` (to get the repo), `git pull` (to update your local copy with remote changes), `git checkout -b branchname` (create and switch to a new branch), `git add` (stage changes), `git commit`, and `git push`. Also `git merge` or `git rebase` for integrating changes. If you prefer GUI tools, VS has built-in Git support (or you can use GitKraken, SourceTree, etc.), but it’s still important to understand what’s happening.

**GitLab Workflow and Tools:**
- **Issues:** GitLab issues are used to track tasks, feature requests, or bugs. Each issue describes a piece of work. They help the team plan and discuss before coding. Often, your team might have an issue for each feature and you’ll work on a branch named after that issue (some teams even enforce branch naming like `issue-123-feature-name`). GitLab **issues help you track work and collaborate** with features like assignees, labels, and milestones ([Manage issues | GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/issues/managing_issues/#:~:text=GitLab%20issues%20help%20you%20track,You%20can%20manage%20issues%20to)).
- **Issue Boards/Milestones:** Your team might use GitLab’s issue boards (like a Kanban) or milestones (for sprints/releases). As a new member, pay attention to how issues are used (e.g., an issue might be assigned to you – meaning you should implement it on a branch and then close it via MR).
- **Opening a Merge Request:** When your code is ready (or even as a Draft/WIP), you open a MR on GitLab. In the MR description, reference the issue it addresses (e.g., “Closes #123”). GitLab can then auto-close the issue when the MR is merged ([Merge requests | GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/#:~:text=discussions%2C%20and%20track%20code%20changes,when%20the%20merge%20request%20merges)). The MR process ensures that your code gets reviewed – be receptive to feedback. Code reviews are a great learning opportunity, especially in a new codebase.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Many projects have CI pipelines that run on each push or MR (to run tests, static analysis, etc.). Check if your team’s repo has a `.gitlab-ci.yml`. If so, learn the basics of the pipeline (so you know why a build might fail – e.g., failing tests). Ensure your contributions pass all checks before asking for a merge.
- **GitLab Etiquette:** Write clear commit messages (e.g., “Add calibration logic to sensor service” instead of “changes”). In MR discussions, be professional and clear. If you are addressing a comment, you can push new commits; GitLab will show the diff. Eventually, you might squash commits or maintain a clean history as per team norms.

**Resources:**

- **(Free)** *Pro Git (Book):* The **[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)** book by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub is available online for free. Chapters 1 and 2 cover the basics of Git (what it is, how to use it) and are highly recommended if you’re new. It explains concepts clearly with examples.
- **(Free)** *GitLab Official Docs:* GitLab has extensive docs. Key ones for you: **Merge Requests** ([Merge requests | GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/#:~:text=Merge%20requests%20provide%20a%20central,when%20the%20merge%20request%20merges)) (explains how to create and what they are for), and **Issues** ([Manage issues | GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/issues/managing_issues/#:~:text=GitLab%20issues%20help%20you%20track,You%20can%20manage%20issues%20to)) (managing issues). These will give you the official picture of how GitLab expects you to use these features and their capabilities (like linking MRs and issues, using templates, etc.).
- **(Free)** *Atlassian Git Tutorials:* (Atlassian (makers of Bitbucket) have an excellent set of tutorials on Git – while they mention Bitbucket, the Git parts apply equally to GitLab.) Topics like branching workflow, resolving merge conflicts, and best practices are covered in an easy-to-follow way.
- **(Free)** *Learn Git Branching (Interactive):* This is a fun web-based interactive visual tool to practice Git commands and branching. It’s great for visualizing what happens with each command. You might use this to practice merges or rebases in a sandbox environment to build confidence.
- **(Free)** *YouTube – “GitLab Flow vs GitFlow” and workflow videos:* There are videos explaining different branching strategies. *GitLab Flow* (which is similar to GitHub Flow but with issue integration) is likely what your team follows: basically, feature branches merged into main, with issues driving the process ([What is GitLab Flow?](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-gitlab-flow/#:~:text=What%20is%20GitLab%20Flow%3F%20GitLab,feature%20branches%20with%20issue%20tracking)). A short video or article on this can solidify how you will work day-to-day.
- **(Paid)** *Udemy “Git Complete” or Coursera version control courses:* If you feel you need a structured course, there are many. **“Git Complete: The Definitive Guide”** on Udemy is a popular one. Coursera also has a version control course in some software engineering specialization. These cover Git thoroughly, but you might not need the full depth if you practice on the job.

**Practice:** Create a dummy repository on GitLab (or GitHub if easier) to play with. For instance, take one of your practice WPF projects and put it on a remote Git repo. Then simulate a small team workflow:
- Create an issue “Improve UI layout”.
- Create a branch for it, do some changes, commit them.
- Push and open a Merge Request on your own repo. Practice writing a good description and linking the issue (`Closes #1` in the MR description).
- Merge the MR (you can self-approve since it’s your repo) and see the issue auto-close.
- Also practice pulling changes: If you have another machine or a friend, have them clone the repo, make a change, push it, and you pull it. Resolving a merge conflict at least once intentionally in a controlled scenario can demystify it.

**Milestone:** *Be comfortable using Git from the command line or IDE and understand the team’s GitLab workflow.* When someone says “push your branch and open a MR” or “this issue is closed by that merge request,” it should be clear to you. You should also be cautious but not afraid of Git – always knowing that if something goes wrong, you have the tools to inspect the repo state (`git log`, `git status`) and stackoverflow/teammates to help. Proficiency in GitLab will also mean you know how to find code in the repository via the web UI, how to comment on MRs, and how to use GitLab’s interface to your advantage (like viewing CI pipeline results or using the “Blame” view to see why something was done).
