## 1. C# and Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals

Start by strengthening your C# fundamentals and understanding core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Since your background is in Python (a dynamically typed language), focus on the syntax and structure of C# as a statically typed, compiled language. Key topics include: basic C# syntax (types, variables, control flow, and LINQ), defining classes and methods, properties and fields, and **OOP principles** – abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism ([Object-Oriented Programming - C# | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/oop#:~:text=C%23%20is%20an%20object,oriented%20programming%20are)). Grasp how these principles manifest in C# (e.g., **encapsulation** with access modifiers and properties, **inheritance** via base and derived classes, etc.). Also familiarize yourself with concepts like interfaces (for defining contracts) and generics (for reusable type-safe code).

- **(Free)** *Microsoft Learn C# Fundamentals:* Microsoft provides free learning paths and tutorials for C#. Begin with interactive lessons or documentation on **C# syntax and OOP** ([Recommended learning resources for C# and .NET in 2024. | by Dr Milan Milanović | Medium](https://medium.com/@techworldwithmilan/recommended-learning-resources-for-c-and-net-in-2024-0eec6ab923ca#:~:text=1.%20Learn%20C)). For example, the [**Object-Oriented Programming in C#** guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/oop) explains OOP concepts in C# with simple examples (like a `BankAccount` class) ([Object-Oriented Programming - C# | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/oop#:~:text=C%23%20is%20an%20object,oriented%20programming%20are)).
- **(Free)** *The C# Yellow Book by Rob Miles:* A popular free e-book (PDF) that introduces C# in a friendly manner. It’s often recommended as a first book (and is updated regularly). *(Free download from [Rob Miles' website](https://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book))* ([Recommended learning resources for C# and .NET in 2024. | by Dr Milan Milanović | Medium](https://medium.com/@techworldwithmilan/recommended-learning-resources-for-c-and-net-in-2024-0eec6ab923ca#:~:text=%2A%20The%20C,the%20best%20book%20overall)).
- **(Free)** *C# for Beginners Video Series (Microsoft Learn):* A series of video lessons for beginners covering setup and basic programming. [C# for Beginners Series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/csharp-for-beginners/)
- **(Free)** *Python To C# Tutorial (GameDev Academy):* A guide specifically for developers transitioning from Python to C#, comparing syntax and concepts ([Python To C# Tutorial - Complete Guide](https://gamedevacademy.org/python-to-c-tutorial-complete-guide/)).
- **(Paid)** *“C# in Depth” by Jon Skeet:* An in-depth book (Manning Publications) suited for going beyond the basics. It’s considered one of the best intermediate-level C# books ([Recommended learning resources for C# and .NET in 2024. | by Dr Milan Milanović | Medium](https://medium.com/@techworldwithmilan/recommended-learning-resources-for-c-and-net-in-2024-0eec6ab923ca#:~:text=4)) – great for later reference to understand advanced language features (LINQ, async/await, newer C# versions).
- **(Paid)** *Pluralsight – C# Fundamentals:* If you prefer video courses, Pluralsight has courses like **“C# Fundamentals”** (by Scott Allen or similar). These are project-based and comprehensive (Pluralsight is subscription-based). Udemy also has popular C# courses (e.g., by Mosh Hamedani or the [Complete C# Course – Beginner to Expert](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-c-sharp-programming-course-beginner-to-expert/)), which are paid but often discounted.

**Milestone:** *Build simple programs in C# on your own.* For example, create a console application that models a real-world scenario (like a simple inventory or a physics calculator). Practice applying OOP: create classes, use inheritance/interfaces, and ensure you understand how to compile and run C# projects. By the end of this phase, you should be comfortable with C# syntax and object-oriented design basics, which will be crucial for understanding the larger WPF/Prism codebase.
