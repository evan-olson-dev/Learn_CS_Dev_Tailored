## 2. Introduction to .NET 6 and Visual Studio

Next, set up your development environment and get acquainted with the .NET platform and tooling. .NET 6 is a **Long-Term Support (LTS)** release of the modern .NET (sometimes called .NET Core) – it’s cross-platform and high-performance. Although WPF is Windows-only, .NET 6 offers advantages like a simplified project format and performance improvements.

Install **Visual Studio 2022** (Community Edition is free) with the “.NET Desktop Development” workload. Visual Studio will be your primary IDE for WPF development, so take time to learn its features:
- **Solutions and Projects:** A *Solution* is a container for one or more projects. In a typical WPF app, the solution might contain the WPF application project and perhaps class library projects. Understand how to create a new project and the role of files like `.csproj` (project file defining references, etc.).
- **IDE Basics:** Learn to navigate Visual Studio’s interface – Solution Explorer (to browse files), Properties window, Toolbox (for UI controls), etc. Visual Studio’s designers and debugging tools will greatly assist you. A good starting point is the official *“Hello World” WPF tutorial* which walks through creating a new WPF project in VS and explains the IDE layout ([Hello World app with WPF in C# - Visual Studio (Windows) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-wpf?view=vs-2022#:~:text=In%20this%20tutorial%2C%20you%20become,IDE)). This will familiarize you with using designers, setting breakpoints, and running the app in debug mode.

- **(Free)** *Visual Studio WPF Tutorial (Microsoft Docs):* Follow the **“Create a WPF application with C#”** tutorial on Microsoft Learn ([Hello World app with WPF in C# - Visual Studio (Windows) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-wpf?view=vs-2022#:~:text=In%20this%20tutorial%2C%20you%20become,IDE)). It’s a step-by-step guide to building a simple “Hello World” WPF app and will introduce you to Visual Studio’s design tools and debugging. You’ll learn how to create a project, design a UI, write some code-behind, and run/debug the app – gaining familiarity with the **Visual Studio IDE** and its panels (toolbox, XAML designer, output window for debugging, etc.).
- **(Free)** *Visual Studio Documentation & Tips:* Microsoft’s documentation has sections on using the **IDE features** (like IntelliSense, the debugger, etc.). Additionally, consider short YouTube videos or Microsoft Channel 9 videos on “Visual Studio productivity tips” to learn handy shortcuts (e.g., how to quickly navigate code, refactor, etc.).
- **(Free)** *The Complete WPF Tutorial – App.xaml:* For insight into WPF project structure, the “Complete WPF Tutorial” website has a page on **App.xaml** and application startup ([Working with App.xaml - The complete WPF tutorial](https://wpf-tutorial.com/wpf-application/working-with-app-xaml/#:~:text=Working%20with%20App)). This explains how a WPF app is structured (App.xaml as the entry point, with a `StartupUri` pointing to the main window) and how XAML and code-behind work together as partial classes. Understanding App.xaml and MainWindow.xaml from this tutorial will reinforce what you see in Visual Studio.
- **(Paid)** *No specific paid resources needed here*, as the free documentation and tutorials are usually sufficient. (If you want a video course on using Visual Studio, Pluralsight’s *“Visual Studio 2022 Essentials”* or similar could be an option, but it’s likely not necessary.)

**Milestone:** *Comfortably navigate and use Visual Studio for .NET development.* You should be able to create a new WPF project, add controls via the XAML designer, write and run code, and debug basic issues (e.g., setting breakpoints to inspect variables). By now, terms like “solution”, “project”, “build”, and “NuGet package” should make sense, even if you haven’t used NuGet yet (we’ll cover that later).
