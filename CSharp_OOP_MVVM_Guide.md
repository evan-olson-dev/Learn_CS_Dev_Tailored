Perfect, thank you for all the detail.
I'll put together a comprehensive learning guide and resource list tailored to a PhD-level academic transitioning into C# development, focusing on .NET 6 WPF desktop applications using the Prism MVVM framework. It will include fundamentals of C# and object-oriented programming, MVVM with Prism, use of Visual Studio, Git/GitLab workflows, unit testing with NUnit, and how to interact with and build upon internal libraries and drivers.

I’ll include both free and high-quality paid resources (clearly marked), and structure the guide for hands-on and progressive learning. I’ll let you know when it’s ready to review.

# Learning Path for .NET 6 WPF Desktop Development (Prism MVVM)

## 1. C# and Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals

Start by strengthening your C# fundamentals and understanding core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Since your background is in Python (a dynamically typed language), focus on the syntax and structure of C# as a statically typed, compiled language. Key topics include: basic C# syntax (types, variables, control flow, and LINQ), defining classes and methods, properties and fields, and **OOP principles** – abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism ([Object-Oriented Programming - C# | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/oop#:~:text=C%23%20is%20an%20object,oriented%20programming%20are)). Grasp how these principles manifest in C# (e.g., **encapsulation** with access modifiers and properties, **inheritance** via base and derived classes, etc.). Also familiarize yourself with concepts like interfaces (for defining contracts) and generics (for reusable type-safe code). 

- **(Free)** *Microsoft Learn C# Fundamentals:* Microsoft provides free learning paths and tutorials for C#. Begin with interactive lessons or documentation on **C# syntax and OOP** ([Recommended learning resources for C# and .NET in 2024. | by Dr Milan Milanović | Medium](https://medium.com/@techworldwithmilan/recommended-learning-resources-for-c-and-net-in-2024-0eec6ab923ca#:~:text=1.%20Learn%20C)). For example, the [**Object-Oriented Programming in C#** guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/oop) explains OOP concepts in C# with simple examples (like a `BankAccount` class) ([Object-Oriented Programming - C# | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/oop#:~:text=C%23%20is%20an%20object,oriented%20programming%20are)).  
- **(Free)** *The C# Yellow Book by Rob Miles:* A popular free e-book (PDF) that introduces C# in a friendly manner. It’s often recommended as a first book (and is updated regularly). *(Free download from csharpcourse.com)* ([Recommended learning resources for C# and .NET in 2024. | by Dr Milan Milanović | Medium](https://medium.com/@techworldwithmilan/recommended-learning-resources-for-c-and-net-in-2024-0eec6ab923ca#:~:text=%2A%20The%20C,the%20best%20book%20overall)).  
- **(Free)** *C# 101 Video Series (Microsoft)*: A series of video lessons for beginners (originally by Bob Tabor). These cover setting up the development environment and writing simple C# programs from scratch.  
- **(Paid)** *“C# in Depth” by Jon Skeet:* An in-depth book (Manning Publications) suited for going beyond the basics. It’s considered one of the best intermediate-level C# books ([Recommended learning resources for C# and .NET in 2024. | by Dr Milan Milanović | Medium](https://medium.com/@techworldwithmilan/recommended-learning-resources-for-c-and-net-in-2024-0eec6ab923ca#:~:text=4)) – great for later reference to understand advanced language features (LINQ, async/await, newer C# versions).  
- **(Paid)** *Pluralsight – C# Fundamentals:* If you prefer video courses, Pluralsight has courses like **“C# Fundamentals”** (by Scott Allen or similar). These are project-based and comprehensive (Pluralsight is subscription-based). Udemy also has popular C# courses (e.g., by Mosh Hamedani), which are paid but often discounted.  

**Milestone:** *Build simple programs in C# on your own.* For example, create a console application that models a real-world scenario (like a simple inventory or a physics calculator). Practice applying OOP: create classes, use inheritance/interfaces, and ensure you understand how to compile and run C# projects. By the end of this phase, you should be comfortable with C# syntax and object-oriented design basics, which will be crucial for understanding the larger WPF/Prism codebase.

## 2. Introduction to .NET 6 and Visual Studio

Next, set up your development environment and get acquainted with the .NET platform and tooling. .NET 6 is a **Long-Term Support (LTS)** release of the modern .NET (sometimes called .NET Core) – it’s cross-platform and high-performance. Although WPF is Windows-only, .NET 6 offers advantages like a simplified project format and performance improvements. 

Install **Visual Studio 2022** (Community Edition is free) with the “.NET Desktop Development” workload. Visual Studio will be your primary IDE for WPF development, so take time to learn its features:
- **Solutions and Projects:** A *Solution* is a container for one or more projects. In a typical WPF app, the solution might contain the WPF application project and perhaps class library projects. Understand how to create a new project and the role of files like `.csproj` (project file defining references, etc.). 
- **IDE Basics:** Learn to navigate Visual Studio’s interface – Solution Explorer (to browse files), Properties window, Toolbox (for UI controls), etc. Visual Studio’s designers and debugging tools will greatly assist you. A good starting point is the official *“Hello World” WPF tutorial* which walks through creating a new WPF project in VS and explains the IDE layout ([Hello World app with WPF in C# - Visual Studio (Windows) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-wpf?view=vs-2022#:~:text=In%20this%20tutorial%2C%20you%20become,IDE)). This will familiarize you with using designers, setting breakpoints, and running the app in debug mode. 

- **(Free)** *Visual Studio WPF Tutorial (Microsoft Docs):* Follow the **“Create a WPF application with C#”** tutorial on Microsoft Learn ([Hello World app with WPF in C# - Visual Studio (Windows) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-wpf?view=vs-2022#:~:text=In%20this%20tutorial%2C%20you%20become,IDE)). It’s a step-by-step guide to building a simple “Hello World” WPF app and will introduce you to Visual Studio’s design tools and debugging. You’ll learn how to create a project, design a UI, write some code-behind, and run/debug the app – gaining familiarity with the **Visual Studio IDE** and its panels (toolbox, XAML designer, output window for debugging, etc.).  
- **(Free)** *Visual Studio Documentation & Tips:* Microsoft’s documentation has sections on using the **IDE features** (like IntelliSense, the debugger, etc.). Additionally, consider short YouTube videos or Microsoft Channel 9 videos on “Visual Studio productivity tips” to learn handy shortcuts (e.g., how to quickly navigate code, refactor, etc.).  
- **(Free)** *The Complete WPF Tutorial – App.xaml:* For insight into WPF project structure, the “Complete WPF Tutorial” website has a page on **App.xaml** and application startup ([Working with App.xaml - The complete WPF tutorial](https://wpf-tutorial.com/wpf-application/working-with-app-xaml/#:~:text=Working%20with%20App)). This explains how a WPF app is structured (App.xaml as the entry point, with a `StartupUri` pointing to the main window) and how XAML and code-behind work together as partial classes. Understanding App.xaml and MainWindow.xaml from this tutorial will reinforce what you see in Visual Studio.  
- **(Paid)** *No specific paid resources needed here*, as the free documentation and tutorials are usually sufficient. (If you want a video course on using Visual Studio, Pluralsight’s *“Visual Studio 2022 Essentials”* or similar could be an option, but it’s likely not necessary.)

**Milestone:** *Comfortably navigate and use Visual Studio for .NET development.* You should be able to create a new WPF project, add controls via the XAML designer, write and run code, and debug basic issues (e.g., setting breakpoints to inspect variables). By now, terms like “solution”, “project”, “build”, and “NuGet package” should make sense, even if you haven’t used NuGet yet (we’ll cover that later).

## 3. WPF and XAML Fundamentals

With C# basics and the IDE in hand, dive into **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)** itself. WPF is the UI framework for building rich desktop applications on Windows ([Hello World app with WPF in C# - Visual Studio (Windows) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-wpf?view=vs-2022#:~:text=Windows%20Presentation%20Foundation%20,data%20binding%2C%20documents%2C%20and%20security)). It uses **XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language)** for designing UI in a declarative way, and C# for code-behind logic. Key WPF concepts and skills to learn:

- **What is WPF?** – Understand that WPF provides a unified approach to developing desktop UIs, including support for controls, layout, data binding, graphics (vector graphics, animations), and more ([Hello World app with WPF in C# - Visual Studio (Windows) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-wpf?view=vs-2022#:~:text=Windows%20Presentation%20Foundation%20,data%20binding%2C%20documents%2C%20and%20security)). WPF separates UI design (XAML) from logic, enabling the MVVM pattern we’ll use. It’s part of .NET, so you write WPF apps in C# (or VB/F#). WPF uses **DirectX under the hood** for rendering, allowing modern UI effects.
- **XAML Basics:** – Learn the syntax of XAML, which is an XML-based language for declaring UI elements. In XAML you define windows, controls (buttons, text boxes, etc.), layouts (panels, grids), and their properties in a hierarchical structure. Get comfortable with the idea that every XAML element maps to a C# class (e.g., `<Button>` corresponds to a `System.Windows.Controls.Button` object). You can achieve the same UI via code, but XAML is more concise and designer-friendly.
- **Layout and Controls:** – Study layout controls like **Grid, StackPanel, DockPanel, Canvas**, etc., which help arrange UI elements. Understand how *attached properties* like `Grid.Row` work to position elements. Explore common controls (Button, TextBlock, TextBox, ListView, etc.) and how to use them in XAML. The **Complete WPF Tutorial** site has sections on various controls and layouts, which is a great free resource to go through.
- **Data Binding:** – *This is a cornerstone of WPF (and MVVM).* Data binding lets you bind UI elements to data sources (like properties of your C# objects). Learn how to use the `{Binding}` syntax in XAML to display and update data. For example, you might bind a TextBox’s `Text` property to a `Name` property of your data model. Along with binding, learn about **INotifyPropertyChanged** – an interface your data classes or ViewModels implement to notify the UI of property changes (so the UI updates automatically). Practice simple bindings (e.g., binding a slider value to a label). 
- **Resources and Styles:** – WPF allows defining *resources* (like brushes, styles, templates) that can be reused. At least get a basic idea that you can define a resource (say a color or a style for buttons) in XAML (in App.xaml or a Window’s resources) and reuse it throughout the app. This is more for later polish, but worth knowing exists.
- **Events vs Commands:** – In WPF, UI events (like button clicks) can be handled in code-behind, but in MVVM we prefer commands. Still, understand how event handlers are wired in XAML (`Click="Button_Click"` in XAML maps to a method in code-behind). This will help you appreciate the command approach when we get to MVVM/Prism. 

**Resources:**

- **(Free)** *Microsoft Desktop Guide for WPF:* Microsoft’s documentation (learn.microsoft.com) for WPF is extensive. Start with topics like **“WPF Overview”** and **“XAML Overview”** to understand the framework’s capabilities and XAML syntax ([Hello World app with WPF in C# - Visual Studio (Windows) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-wpf?view=vs-2022#:~:text=WPF%20is%20part%20of%20,more%20information%2C%20see%20%206)). The docs also have guides on layout and data binding. For example, the **Data Binding Overview** explains how WPF’s binding system works and introduces concepts like data contexts and converters (very useful when you start MVVM).  
- **(Free)** *The Complete WPF Tutorial:* This community-driven tutorial (at wpf-tutorial.com) is a goldmine for beginners. It’s organized into short chapters covering everything from basic controls to advanced topics. It provides code examples and images. Key sections to focus on initially: **WPF Application Structure** (explains App.xaml and MainWindow), **Layout** (panels like Grid, StackPanel), **Data Binding Basics**, and **Events in WPF**. The tutorial is free and will give you a practical, code-focused understanding of WPF’s pieces (with less formality than MS Docs).  
- **(Free)** *Syncfusion’s **WPF Succinctly** e-book:* Syncfusion offers a free e-book *“WPF Succinctly”* (PDF, requires a free sign-up). It’s a concise introduction (~100 pages) covering WPF fundamentals and even touches on MVVM. This can reinforce your learning with another explanation style.  
- **(Paid)** *“WPF 4.5 Unleashed” by Adam Nathan:* A highly regarded book for WPF. Even though it targets .NET 4.x, WPF itself hasn’t drastically changed, so the content is very relevant. It’s a visually rich book and covers almost all of WPF (controls, binding, resources, animations, etc.). It’s great for deepening your understanding and as a reference.  
- **(Paid)** *Pluralsight – WPF Fundamentals:* Pluralsight likely has a course such as **“WPF Fundamentals”** or **“WPF for Beginners”**. These can be useful if you prefer guided video learning. One example is a course by Walt Ritscher or Ian Griffiths on WPF, which walks through building a UI, handling input, and data binding, etc.

**Hands-On Practice:** As you learn WPF, **build a small demo app**. For instance, create a “Contact Manager” – a window with text fields for a person’s name, email, phone and a list to display added contacts. Practice using layouts (to align labels and textboxes), data binding (bind the input fields to a simple Person object), and events or commands (e.g., a Button click adds the new contact to the list). Even without full MVVM structure yet, try to separate out your data logic from UI as much as you can (this sets the stage for MVVM). This project will solidify concepts like XAML layout and binding.

**Milestone:** *You should now be comfortable creating a basic WPF UI and understand how XAML and C# interact.* You should know how to use data binding to connect UI to data, and have a mental model of the WPF application structure (App.xaml launching a Window, the visual tree of controls, etc.). When you run into something like “why doesn’t my UI update when I change this property?”, you should recall that INotifyPropertyChanged might be needed – which means you’re ready to learn MVVM next.

## 4. Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Design Pattern

With WPF basics in hand, it’s crucial to adopt the **MVVM design pattern** for structuring your application. MVVM is the architectural pattern that underpins modern WPF development and is a central concept for the Prism framework. It helps **separate concerns** in your application: the UI (View), the logic/state (ViewModel), and the data/business layer (Model) ([Implementing the MVVM Pattern Using the Prism Library for WPF | Prism ](https://prismlibrary.github.io/docs/wpf/legacy/Implementing-MVVM.html#:~:text=Using%20the%20MVVM%20pattern%2C%20the,application%27s%20business%20logic%20and%20data)). This separation makes your app more maintainable, testable, and collaborative (developers can work on ViewModel logic while designers tweak XAML, etc.).

**What is MVVM?** – In MVVM, you have:
- **Model:** Represents the data or business logic, typically POCO classes or services that retrieve data (e.g., a `SensorReading` class or a data service). Models should be unaware of the UI.
- **View:** The UI layer (XAML plus code-behind for a Window or UserControl). The View’s job is to define the layout and visual aspects. Ideally, the code-behind in the View should be minimal (only UI-specific code that doesn’t belong in ViewModel). The View binds to a ViewModel to get its data.
- **ViewModel:** The intermediary that holds the presentation logic and state for the View. The ViewModel exposes properties (and collections) that the View can data-bind to, and commands that the View can trigger (instead of handling UI events directly). The ViewModel interacts with Models (calls methods, retrieves data) and prepares data for display. Importantly, it implements `INotifyPropertyChanged` to notify the View of property changes, so the UI stays in sync with data.

The **MVVM interaction** is primarily through data binding and commands:
- The View’s `DataContext` is set to an instance of the ViewModel. This means any `{Binding XYZ}` in the XAML will look for an `XYZ` property in the ViewModel. For example, if your ViewModel has a `Temperature` property and the View has a TextBlock with `Text="{Binding Temperature}"`, it will display that value. When the ViewModel updates `Temperature` (and raises PropertyChanged), the UI updates ([Implementing the MVVM Pattern Using the Prism Library for WPF | Prism ](https://prismlibrary.github.io/docs/wpf/legacy/Implementing-MVVM.html#:~:text=In%20WPF%2C%20data%20binding%20expressions,view%20and%20its%20view%20model)).
- User actions (like button clicks) are typically bound to **ICommand** properties in the ViewModel (using XAML `{Binding SaveCommand}` and Button’s `Command` property). This replaces the need for code-behind event handlers and allows the ViewModel to handle the logic in response to UI interactions.
- The ViewModel can also respond to changes in Models or trigger navigation, etc., but at its core, it’s the mediator between View and Model.

**Why MVVM?** – It leads to cleaner separation. You can **unit test** the ViewModel without any UI. It also aligns well with WPF’s data binding. Microsoft designed WPF with MVVM in mind (it’s a “Presentation Model” pattern). Using MVVM, you avoid tightly coupling UI to logic, making it easier to modify one without breaking the other ([Implementing the MVVM Pattern Using the Prism Library for WPF | Prism ](https://prismlibrary.github.io/docs/wpf/legacy/Implementing-MVVM.html#:~:text=Using%20the%20MVVM%20pattern%2C%20the,application%27s%20business%20logic%20and%20data)). In practice, MVVM might feel like extra setup at first (more classes), but for non-trivial apps it pays off with easier maintenance and extension.

**Learn MVVM Step by Step:**
- Start with a simple example: perhaps revisit your “Contact Manager” or a **basic calculator** and refactor it to MVVM. Create a ViewModel (e.g., `ContactManagerViewModel`) that has properties for the form fields and a collection for contacts. Bind the TextBoxes to ViewModel properties instead of using them directly. Implement a command (e.g., `AddContactCommand`) that takes the input and adds a new item to the list. Remove as much logic from code-behind as possible – the code-behind might only initialize the ViewModel and set `DataContext`. This exercise will help you see MVVM in action.
- Implementing **INotifyPropertyChanged**: Write a base ViewModel class that implements this interface (there are many examples online). This base class has a helper method to raise the `PropertyChanged` event. Then your actual ViewModel classes can inherit from it. This is standard in MVVM to reduce boilerplate. (In Prism, you’ll later use its `BindableBase` which already provides this functionality).
- Implementing **ICommand**: Understand that an `ICommand` has an `Execute` and `CanExecute`. A common approach is to use a `RelayCommand` or `DelegateCommand` (Prism provides `DelegateCommand`) where you simply provide the logic to execute. For now, you can either implement a simple `RelayCommand` class (many tutorials show how) or use Prism’s later. The idea is to expose commands from the ViewModel for the UI to bind to.

**Resources:**

- **(Free)** *MVVM Basics – Microsoft Docs or Blogs:* Look for Microsoft’s documentation or blog posts introducing MVVM. For example, the Microsoft Docs (older “Prism” guide or “WPF Model-View-ViewModel toolkit” guidance) discuss the pattern. One core explanation: *“MVVM pattern helps to cleanly separate the business and presentation logic of your application from its UI… The view interacts with the view model through data binding, commands, and notifications.”* ([Implementing the MVVM Pattern Using the Prism Library for WPF | Prism ](https://prismlibrary.github.io/docs/wpf/legacy/Implementing-MVVM.html#:~:text=Using%20the%20MVVM%20pattern%2C%20the,application%27s%20business%20logic%20and%20data)) ([Implementing the MVVM Pattern Using the Prism Library for WPF | Prism ](https://prismlibrary.github.io/docs/wpf/legacy/Implementing-MVVM.html#:~:text=The%20MVVM%20pattern%20is%20a,data%20templates%2C%20commands%2C%20and%20behaviors)). Reading such overviews will reinforce the concepts.  
- **(Free)** *Prism Library MVVM Overview:* The Prism documentation itself contains a section *“Implementing the MVVM Pattern”* ([Implementing the MVVM Pattern Using the Prism Library for WPF | Prism ](https://prismlibrary.github.io/docs/wpf/legacy/Implementing-MVVM.html#:~:text=Using%20the%20MVVM%20pattern%2C%20the,application%27s%20business%20logic%20and%20data)) which, despite being in Prism docs, is a great general MVVM explanation. It covers the responsibilities of View, ViewModel, and Model, and how they interact (with diagrams). It’s worth a read to solidify your understanding of the pattern in the context of WPF.  
- **(Free)** *MVVM Light Toolkit or Community Blogs:* You might come across references to MVVM frameworks like MVVM Light (by Laurent Bugnion) or others. While you’ll be focusing on Prism, sometimes skimming an article or two about MVVM Light’s usage can give additional perspective on MVVM (since all MVVM frameworks share the same fundamentals). Blogs like those on CodeProject (e.g., “MVVM for Beginners”) or YouTube videos explaining MVVM pattern with a small demo can be helpful.  
- **(Paid)** *Pluralsight – “MVVM Fundamentals” or “WPF MVVM” courses:* Pluralsight has specific courses focused on MVVM in WPF. One example is *“WPF MVVM: Introduction to Model-View-ViewModel”*. These courses typically walk through building an app with MVVM, and might introduce a lightweight toolkit. It can be useful to see the pattern applied in a guided way.  
- **(Paid)** *“Developer’s Guide to Microsoft Prism” (Book/PDF):* This was an older Microsoft patterns & practices guide (for Prism 4) which covered MVVM concepts as well. Though dated, if you find a PDF, the MVVM chapters are still relevant. Alternatively, **“Advanced MVVM”** by Josh Smith (an expert in WPF) is a PDF/book often recommended for deep MVVM insights (though possibly beyond beginner needs).

**Milestone:** *Apply MVVM to a simple WPF feature.* You should reach a point where given a new UI requirement, you naturally think in terms of “What’s the ViewModel? What are the Model classes? How will the View bind to the VM?” For example, if asked to create a form that controls some hardware (e.g., a pump on/off, with a reading of current pressure), you’d identify the need for a `PumpViewModel` with properties like `IsPumpOn` and `Pressure`, a command `TogglePumpCommand`, and a service Model that actually interfaces with the hardware. Achieving this mindset means you’re ready to leverage Prism to streamline MVVM in larger apps.

## 5. Prism MVVM Framework (for WPF)

Now that you have a grasp of MVVM, it’s time to introduce **Prism** – the framework your team uses. Prism is a collection of libraries and guidance from the .NET Foundation (originally from Microsoft patterns & practices) that helps build **modular, maintainable, MVVM-oriented applications** ([
	A Properly Pleasing Primer Tutorial for WPF Prism - Part 1:  Introduction | DMC, Inc.

](https://www.dmcinfo.com/latest-thinking/blog/id/9282/a-properly-pleasing-primer-tutorial-for-wpf-prism--part-1-introduction#:~:text=Prism%20provides%20guidance%20designed%20to,built%20for)). Prism is not the only MVVM framework, but it’s powerful and well-suited for complex WPF apps, especially those that may grow or need a plug-in architecture.

**What Prism Provides:** Prism’s goal is to make it easier to implement MVVM and other good architectural patterns. Key features of Prism include:
- **Bootstrapping/Initialization:** Prism provides a `PrismApplication` base class (or used to use a Bootstrapper) to initialize your application. This sets up things like dependency injection container and region navigation.
- **Modularity:** You can split your app into multiple modules (assemblies) that can be loaded on startup or on demand. This is useful if your app has distinct functional areas (for example, a module for Data Acquisition, another for Data Analysis, etc.). Prism helps register modules and inject their views/services as needed.
- **Regions and View Composition:** Prism introduces the concept of *Regions* – think of them as named placeholders in your UI (e.g., a `<ContentControl>` that is a region). You can inject views into regions, allowing dynamic composition of UI. This is how you can have a shell (main window) that loads different views into a central area based on navigation or user actions. It decouples the shell from specific views. 
- **View/ViewModel Locator:** Prism can automatically wire Views and ViewModels. If you follow a naming convention (e.g., your View is `MainView` and ViewModel is `MainViewModel` in the same namespace), Prism’s ViewModelLocator will automatically create and assign the ViewModel as DataContext of the View. This saves boilerplate code.
- **Commands and Events:** Prism provides `DelegateCommand` (an implementation of ICommand) which makes commanding easier (you can pass a lambda for execute and can-execute logic). It also has **CompositeCommands** if you need to tie multiple commands together (useful for global toolbar commands, etc.). Additionally, Prism’s **EventAggregator** is a pub-sub event system for communication between components/viewmodels that don’t directly know about each other (for example, if a hardware sensor raises an event that multiple parts of the UI should respond to, you can publish an event). This helps maintain loose coupling.
- **Dependency Injection (DI) Container:** Prism doesn’t force a specific DI container (it used to support Unity, MEF, etc., and now works with Microsoft’s DI or others). It basically helps register types and resolve them. This means your services (like hardware interfaces) can be registered and easily injected into ViewModels. You don’t have to manually create those connections – the container does it, improving testability and flexibility. (In Prism, you’ll typically register types with a container in the startup).
- **Navigation:** Prism has a built-in navigation framework on top of regions. You can request navigation to a view in a region by view name (or type), and Prism handles showing that view, optionally keeping a journal (for back/forward navigation). This is useful for multi-page apps.
- **Dialogs:** Prism has services for common things like showing dialogs in an MVVM-friendly way (IDialogService).

In summary, Prism is there to handle the “plumbing” of a well-structured WPF app, so you can focus on business logic. It embodies patterns like MVVM, event aggregator, dependency injection, etc., which allow creating *“loosely coupled, modular applications… built to last and built for change.”* ([
	A Properly Pleasing Primer Tutorial for WPF Prism - Part 1:  Introduction | DMC, Inc.

](https://www.dmcinfo.com/latest-thinking/blog/id/9282/a-properly-pleasing-primer-tutorial-for-wpf-prism--part-1-introduction#:~:text=Prism%20provides%20guidance%20designed%20to,built%20for)) Many of these features (like commands, INotifyPropertyChanged support) align exactly with what your app needs (and you would otherwise write yourself). Prism just gives them to you in a consistent package.

**Getting Started with Prism:**
- **Set up a Prism project:** The easiest way is to use the Prism Template Pack (if available in Visual Studio Marketplace) which can create a new WPF Prism application for you. Alternatively, you add Prism via NuGet to an existing WPF project. Key NuGet packages: `Prism.Wpf` (core Prism for WPF) and perhaps `Prism.Unity` or `Prism.DryIoc` depending on the DI container your team uses. The template or documentation will guide the needed setup (like your `App.xaml.cs` should inherit `PrismApplication` and call `InitializeComponent` and register modules).
- **Understand the Shell:** In Prism, the *Shell* is typically the main window of the application. The shell XAML might define regions (e.g., a Menu region, a Content region). Part of Prism setup is to show this shell at startup and initialize regions.
- **Module Loading:** Learn how Prism discovers and loads modules. In Prism 8 (for .NET 6), you might use attribute-based module registration or register in code. Each module will have an initialization class where you register its components (views, viewmodels, services). For example, `SensorModule` might register `ISensorService` and its implementation, and maybe register a view for navigation.
- **Navigation and Regions:** Practice creating two simple views and navigate between them using Prism’s `IRegionManager`. For instance, have a “HomeModule” with a HomeView and a “SettingsModule” with a SettingsView. Use a Region (content control) in Shell to display them. Trigger navigation via a command (perhaps hooked to a menu or buttons). This will demonstrate how Prism loads views into regions dynamically.
- **Dependency Injection with Prism:** If you have an interface `ISensorService` and an implementation that reads from hardware or a simulator, register it with Prism’s container in the App initialization (or Module initialization). Then, in your ViewModel constructor, you can request `ISensorService` via constructor injection. Prism (via the DI container) will automatically provide it. This pattern decouples your ViewModel from concrete implementations and makes unit testing (with mocks) possible.

**Resources:**

- **(Free)** *Prism Official Documentation:* The Prism GitHub has a **documentation site** (prismlibrary.github.io) with up-to-date guides. Key sections to read: **“Prism Library for WPF – Overview”** and **“Getting Started with Prism in WPF”**. These will walk through setting up a basic Prism app and explain concepts like Shell, Bootstrapping, regions, etc. The docs also include an *MVVM Primer* which we mentioned earlier, and advanced topics when you need them.  
- **(Free)** *Prism Samples (GitHub):* The Prism team provides a repository of sample applications on GitHub: **PrismLibrary/Prism-Samples-Wpf**. These samples are organized by feature – e.g., there’s a sample for using the EventAggregator, one for Region Navigation, one for Dialogs, etc. It’s recommended to start from the first sample (Bootstrapping) and progress sequentially ([GitHub - PrismLibrary/Prism-Samples-Wpf: Samples that demonstrate how to use various Prism features with WPF](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism-Samples-Wpf#:~:text=Samples%20that%20demonstrate%20how%20to,on%20the%20previous%20sample%27s%20concept)), because each sample builds on the previous concept. By examining these, you can see the minimal code needed to use each Prism feature in isolation. This is a great way to learn by example.  
- **(Free)** *“Properly Pleasing Prism Primer” blog series (DMC, Inc.):* This is a three-part blog series that goes through building a Prism application step-by-step (Part 1: Introduction, Part 2: Shell/Bootstrapper, Part 3: Modules). It’s a bit older but still relevant to Prism fundamentals. It explains what Prism is in very approachable terms (including its history and features) ([

](https://www.dmcinfo.com/latest-thinking/blog/id/9282/a-properly-pleasing-primer-tutorial-for-wpf-prism--part-1-introduction#:~:text=including%20modular%20programming%20support%2C%20event,of%20them%20as%20they%20want)) and then gets hands-on with code. Following along with such a tutorial can solidify how everything ties together (especially the bootstrapper/initialization which can be the trickiest part).  
- **(Paid)** *Pluralsight – “Introduction to Prism for WPF” by Brian Lagunas:* Brian Lagunas is one of the maintainers of Prism. His course on Pluralsight is a comprehensive introduction to Prism (covering Prism 7/8). It goes through building a sample app using Prism, demonstrating regions, module loading, navigation, etc., with clear explanations. This is arguably one of the best ways to learn Prism if you have access to Pluralsight, as it’s practically oriented and up-to-date with Prism’s latest version.  
- **(Paid)** *“Prism in Practice” or other books:* There may not be a very recent Prism book (most are from the Prism 4 or 5 era), but if you prefer books, search for **“Prism WPF book”**. One example is *“Prism 4 in Action”*, though it’s quite dated and tied to older .NET. You might not need a book given the online resources and your hands-on practice, but it’s worth knowing these exist. Often the official documentation plus sample code is sufficient for Prism.

**Hands-On with Prism:** Create a new branch of your WPF test project to integrate Prism. Alternatively, start a fresh small Prism demo: for instance, a **“Modular Sensor Monitor”** app. The Shell (MainWindow) could have two regions: one for navigation (like a List or Buttons to switch views) and one for content. Implement two modules: *SensorDashboardModule* and *SensorSettingsModule*. The Dashboard view could display a fake sensor reading, and the Settings view could have some settings (like a threshold). Use Prism’s navigation to switch between them. Use an EventAggregator event to simulate broadcasting a sensor value update that multiple components could listen to. While this app is trivial, doing this exercise will make you go through: setting up PrismApplication, registering modules, defining regions in XAML, and navigating – covering the core Prism workflow. 

**Milestone:** *Be able to contribute to your team’s Prism application.* After this, you should feel comfortable reading the structure of your real project: identifying modules, understanding how ViewModels are wired via Prism, how navigation is done, etc. You should know how to add a new View + ViewModel following Prism conventions, how to register it, and how to call into shared services via DI. Essentially, Prism’s concepts (regions, commands, DI, events) should not feel mysterious – you’ll know their purpose and usage in your project’s context.

## 6. WPF Development Tools and Practices in Visual Studio

As you start working on a real WPF/Prism project, there are tools and practices that can boost your productivity and code quality. This section highlights some **Visual Studio features and additional tools** particularly useful for WPF:

- **XAML Designer & Live Visual Tree:** Visual Studio has a XAML Designer that shows a live preview of your window/user control. In VS 2022, **XAML Hot Reload** allows you to edit XAML while the app is running and see changes instantly. Practice using Hot Reload – it can drastically speed up UI tweaking. The **Live Visual Tree** and **Live Property Explorer** (available during debugging) let you inspect the UI element hierarchy and their properties at runtime. This is great for diagnosing layout or binding issues (you can see if a control has the DataContext you expect, etc.).
- **Debugging Data Bindings:** By default, WPF will output binding errors to the Output window (Debug output). Get used to watching those messages – if something is not showing up in the UI, often a binding path typo or missing DataContext is the culprit and the error will appear there. You can also enable **Break on Binding Errors** in Visual Studio (in Exceptions Settings) to catch these. Additionally, consider using **Snoop** or **Live Visual Tree** to inspect runtime UI – they can show the DataContext of controls and the values of bound properties.
- **Coding Productivity:** Use **IntelliSense** to its fullest – Visual Studio will help complete XAML bindings and resource keys. The **Go To Definition** (F12) works for XAML as well (e.g., go to the definition of a ViewModel class from XAML binding). Learn refactorings (like renaming properties via Visual Studio so that bindings update too thanks to nameof or refactor sync).
- **XAML Styler** (Extension): A handy VS extension that can format your XAML consistently (helps readability).
- **Resharper or Roslyn Analyzers:** If available, tools like ReSharper can greatly help navigate and refactor code, and provide warnings (e.g., if a property is bound in XAML but doesn’t exist on ViewModel, it can flag that). Even without paid tools, enabling **Code Analysis** in your project or using Roslyn analyzers (some come with the .NET SDK) can catch potential issues.
- **Project & Solution Structure:** Work with your team to understand how the solution is organized. Likely, they have separate class library projects for things like “Core” or “Services” (e.g., an internal library for hardware interfaces might be its own project or delivered via a NuGet package). Understand the **assembly references** and dependencies between projects. For example, your WPF application project might reference an internal “Sensors.dll” or similar. It’s good practice to keep a clean separation (the WPF project for UI, the core logic in libraries). Ensure you know *where* to add code depending on what it is (UI code vs. backend logic).
- **Build and Deployment:** Since it’s a desktop app, you might deploy via an installer or just an EXE with libraries. Visual Studio can publish self-contained EXEs if needed. While this might be handled by others, it’s useful to know how the app is deployed to users (MSI, ClickOnce, etc.) to not break any assumptions when adding dependencies.

**Resources:**

- **(Free)** *Visual Studio XAML Hot Reload Docs:* Microsoft’s docs on XAML Hot Reload and the Live Visual Tree will show you how to use these features. There are also Channel 9 videos or YouTube videos demonstrating XAML Hot Reload in action (which can be quite inspiring to see complex UI updating live).  
- **(Free)** *Blog: “Debugging WPF Bindings”:* There are many blog posts on this topic. They suggest tips like using `PresentationTraceSources.TraceLevel` in XAML to debug specific bindings, or how to interpret common binding errors. One such resource could be a blog on Medium or a Q&A on StackOverflow summarizing debugging techniques.  
- **(Free)** *Snoop (Open Source Tool):* Snoop is a popular free utility that attaches to a running WPF app and lets you inspect and even edit the visuals and data contexts on the fly (somewhat like browser dev tools but for WPF). It’s not an official MS tool, but many WPF devs use it. You can find it on GitHub. It’s worth knowing about for advanced debugging of UI issues.  
- **(Paid)** *ReSharper:* If your team uses ReSharper (JetBrains), invest time in learning its shortcuts and features for XAML and C#. It can generate properties, implement interfaces, and find usages very effectively, which can save time in a large project.  
- **(Free/Paid)** *Community & Q&A:* As you start doing more WPF/Prism, you’ll likely encounter specific questions (e.g., “How do I manage dialogs in MVVM?” or “Prism region navigation not working,” etc.). Remember that **Stack Overflow** has a lot of Q&A on WPF and Prism. The Prism GitHub also has an active community discussions. Don’t hesitate to search those when stuck – often someone had a similar question. Keeping a list of useful Q&A (with solutions from Prism’s maintainers) can be handy.

**Milestone:** *Be proficient in using the available tools to troubleshoot and polish the application.* You should be able to diagnose a UI bug or binding issue systematically (using debug output or Snoop), rather than guesswork. Also, you should feel that the IDE and tools are helping you (not hindering) – meaning you know the basic shortcuts to run tests, launch the app, navigate code, etc. Essentially, at this point, working in the WPF project day-to-day should feel comfortable and efficient.

## 7. Source Control with Git and GitLab

Modern development is collaborative, and your team uses **Git** with **GitLab** for version control and project management. Even if you have used Git minimally, it’s important to become fluent in common Git operations and understand the typical workflow on GitLab (especially regarding branches, merge requests, and issue tracking).

**Git Fundamentals:** Git is a *distributed version control system* – it tracks changes in your code and allows multiple developers to work simultaneously without overriding each other’s work ([What is Git - A Beginner's Guide to Git Version Control | DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/all-about-git#:~:text=Git%20is%20a%20distributed%20version,don%27t%20conflict%20with%20each%20other)). Key concepts to master:
- **Repository:** A Git repository is essentially your project’s tracked content (files and history). You’ll clone the repository from GitLab to your local machine to work on it.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of changes. You’ll make commits locally with clear messages describing *what* and *why* you changed something. Commit often to save incremental progress.
- **Branch:** A separate line of development. Your team likely uses branches for features or bug fixes (e.g., `feature/add-new-sensor` branch). The `main` (or `master`) branch is usually the stable integration branch. Learn to create, switch, and merge branches. Branching allows you to work on new features without disturbing the main code until it’s ready.
- **Merge (Pull) Request:** In GitLab, a *Merge Request (MR)* is how you propose merging your branch into another (usually into `main` or a release branch). It’s a central place for code **review, discussion, and tracking changes** ([Merge requests | GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/#:~:text=Merge%20requests%20provide%20a%20central,when%20the%20merge%20request%20merges)). You’ll push your branch to GitLab and open a MR. Team members (reviewers) will comment on the code, suggest changes, and eventually approve the MR. Once approved, it gets merged into the main codebase.
- **Conflicts:** Sometimes two changes conflict (e.g., you and someone else edited the same file). You’ll need to merge the latest main into your branch and resolve conflicts manually. It’s a common task – learn how to read conflict markers and test after merging.
- **Basic Commands:** Know how to `git clone` (to get the repo), `git pull` (to update your local copy with remote changes), `git checkout -b branchname` (create and switch to a new branch), `git add` (stage changes), `git commit`, and `git push`. Also `git merge` or `git rebase` for integrating changes. If you prefer GUI tools, VS has built-in Git support (or you can use GitKraken, SourceTree, etc.), but it’s still important to understand what’s happening.

**GitLab Workflow and Tools:**
- **Issues:** GitLab issues are used to track tasks, feature requests, or bugs. Each issue describes a piece of work. They help the team plan and discuss before coding. Often, your team might have an issue for each feature and you’ll work on a branch named after that issue (some teams even enforce branch naming like `issue-123-feature-name`). GitLab **issues help you track work and collaborate** with features like assignees, labels, and milestones ([Manage issues | GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/issues/managing_issues/#:~:text=GitLab%20issues%20help%20you%20track,You%20can%20manage%20issues%20to)).
- **Issue Boards/Milestones:** Your team might use GitLab’s issue boards (like a Kanban) or milestones (for sprints/releases). As a new member, pay attention to how issues are used (e.g., an issue might be assigned to you – meaning you should implement it on a branch and then close it via MR).
- **Opening a Merge Request:** When your code is ready (or even as a Draft/WIP), you open a MR on GitLab. In the MR description, reference the issue it addresses (e.g., “Closes #123”). GitLab can then auto-close the issue when the MR is merged ([Merge requests | GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/#:~:text=discussions%2C%20and%20track%20code%20changes,when%20the%20merge%20request%20merges)). The MR process ensures that your code gets reviewed – be receptive to feedback. Code reviews are a great learning opportunity, especially in a new codebase.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Many projects have CI pipelines that run on each push or MR (to run tests, static analysis, etc.). Check if your team’s repo has a `.gitlab-ci.yml`. If so, learn the basics of the pipeline (so you know why a build might fail – e.g., failing tests). Ensure your contributions pass all checks before asking for a merge.
- **GitLab Etiquette:** Write clear commit messages (e.g., “Add calibration logic to sensor service” instead of “changes”). In MR discussions, be professional and clear. If you are addressing a comment, you can push new commits; GitLab will show the diff. Eventually, you might squash commits or maintain a clean history as per team norms.

**Resources:**

- **(Free)** *Pro Git (Book):* The **Pro Git** book by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub is available online for free. Chapters 1 and 2 cover the basics of Git (what it is, how to use it) and are highly recommended if you’re new. It explains concepts clearly with examples.  
- **(Free)** *GitLab Official Docs:* GitLab has extensive docs. Key ones for you: **Merge Requests** ([Merge requests | GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/#:~:text=Merge%20requests%20provide%20a%20central,when%20the%20merge%20request%20merges)) (explains how to create and what they are for), and **Issues** ([Manage issues | GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/issues/managing_issues/#:~:text=GitLab%20issues%20help%20you%20track,You%20can%20manage%20issues%20to)) (managing issues). These will give you the official picture of how GitLab expects you to use these features and their capabilities (like linking MRs and issues, using templates, etc.).  
- **(Free)** *Atlassian Git Tutorials:* (Atlassian (makers of Bitbucket) have an excellent set of tutorials on Git – while they mention Bitbucket, the Git parts apply equally to GitLab.) Topics like branching workflow, resolving merge conflicts, and best practices are covered in an easy-to-follow way.  
- **(Free)** *Learn Git Branching (Interactive):* This is a fun web-based interactive visual tool to practice Git commands and branching. It’s great for visualizing what happens with each command. You might use this to practice merges or rebases in a sandbox environment to build confidence.  
- **(Free)** *YouTube – “GitLab Flow vs GitFlow” and workflow videos:* There are videos explaining different branching strategies. *GitLab Flow* (which is similar to GitHub Flow but with issue integration) is likely what your team follows: basically, feature branches merged into main, with issues driving the process ([What is GitLab Flow?](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-gitlab-flow/#:~:text=What%20is%20GitLab%20Flow%3F%20GitLab,feature%20branches%20with%20issue%20tracking)). A short video or article on this can solidify how you will work day-to-day.  
- **(Paid)** *Udemy “Git Complete” or Coursera version control courses:* If you feel you need a structured course, there are many. **“Git Complete: The Definitive Guide”** on Udemy is a popular one. Coursera also has a version control course in some software engineering specialization. These cover Git thoroughly, but you might not need the full depth if you practice on the job.

**Practice:** Create a dummy repository on GitLab (or GitHub if easier) to play with. For instance, take one of your practice WPF projects and put it on a remote Git repo. Then simulate a small team workflow:
- Create an issue “Improve UI layout”.
- Create a branch for it, do some changes, commit them.
- Push and open a Merge Request on your own repo. Practice writing a good description and linking the issue (`Closes #1` in the MR description).
- Merge the MR (you can self-approve since it’s your repo) and see the issue auto-close. 
- Also practice pulling changes: If you have another machine or a friend, have them clone the repo, make a change, push it, and you pull it. Resolving a merge conflict at least once intentionally in a controlled scenario can demystify it.

**Milestone:** *Be comfortable using Git from the command line or IDE and understand the team’s GitLab workflow.* When someone says “push your branch and open a MR” or “this issue is closed by that merge request,” it should be clear to you. You should also be cautious but not afraid of Git – always knowing that if something goes wrong, you have the tools to inspect the repo state (`git log`, `git status`) and stackoverflow/teammates to help. Proficiency in GitLab will also mean you know how to find code in the repository via the web UI, how to comment on MRs, and how to use GitLab’s interface to your advantage (like viewing CI pipeline results or using the “Blame” view to see why something was done).

## 8. Unit Testing with NUnit in .NET

Quality and correctness are vital, especially in applications that might interface with hardware (where mistakes could be costly). **Unit testing** is the practice of writing automated tests for small units of your code (typically at the function or class level) to ensure they work as intended. You mentioned the team uses **NUnit** for testing .NET projects, so we’ll focus on that.

**Why Unit Test?** – Unit tests allow you to verify code behavior quickly and catch regressions when changes are made. By writing tests, you often improve your code design (making it more testable usually makes it more modular and decoupled). Good unit tests give confidence that new changes haven’t broken existing functionality. As you integrate into the team, contributing tests alongside code will likely be expected. Remember: *writing tests helps catch bugs early and saves time in the long run* ([Getting Started With .NET Unit Testing Using NUnit](https://www.infragistics.com/blogs/net-unit-testing-using-nunit/#:~:text=Automated%20unit%20tests%20while%20developing,code%20for%20different%20input%20sets)).

**NUnit Basics:** NUnit is a popular testing framework for .NET:
- A test project is usually a separate project in the solution (often named something like *ProjectName.Tests*). It references the main project or libraries to access the code under test.
- Install **NUnit** (framework) and **NUnit3TestAdapter** (for running tests in VS) via NuGet in the test project. Visual Studio’s test runner (Test Explorer) will then be able to discover and run NUnit tests. (If you use the template `dotnet new nunit`, it sets this up).
- Writing a test: Create a class (e.g., `SensorServiceTests`). Mark it with `[TestFixture]` (though in NUnit this is optional in newer versions). Write public methods in it and mark each with `[Test]` ([Unit testing C# with NUnit and .NET Core - .NET | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-nunit#:~:text=The%20%60,method%20is%20a%20test%20method)). Each such method is one unit test. Inside, instantiate the class under test (or use a test fixture setup) and use **Assert** statements to verify behavior. For example: `Assert.AreEqual(expectedValue, actualValue)` will make the test *fail* if the values don’t match.
- **Test Setup/Teardown:** You can annotate methods with `[SetUp]` to run code before each test (commonly used to initialize common objects) and `[TearDown]` to clean up after each test. There’s also `[OneTimeSetUp]`/`[OneTimeTearDown]` for once per fixture.
- **Running tests:** In Visual Studio, open Test Explorer to run tests and see results. NUnit also allows running tests via the command line (`dotnet test`). The output will show which tests passed or failed (and stack traces for failures).
- **Test cases and categories:** NUnit supports parameterized tests via `[TestCase(...)]` attributes, which allow you to run the same test code with different inputs. It also has `[Category]` for grouping tests, but initially you might not need that.

**Approach to Unit Testing:** 
- Aim to test the **logic** in ViewModels and Models, not the UI (you won’t unit test XAML code-behind or UI rendering – those are better covered by integration tests or manually). With MVVM, most of your logic sits in ViewModels and services which are perfect for unit testing. For example, if you have a `SensorDataProcessor` class or a method that calculates an average, write tests for those.
- Use **dependency injection** and interfaces to your advantage: If a ViewModel depends on an `ISensorService`, in your tests you can provide a fake implementation of that interface that returns controlled data. This isolates the ViewModel logic. Alternatively, learn to use a **mocking framework** like Moq or NSubstitute to create mock objects for interfaces; these can simulate various scenarios (like sensor returns null, or throws exception) to test how your code handles them.
- Write tests for both **expected behavior** and **edge cases/error conditions**. For instance, a method that converts raw sensor bytes to a value should be tested with normal data and also with extreme or invalid data to ensure it handles them gracefully (perhaps throwing an exception, which you can verify with `Assert.Throws`).
- **NUnit Assertions:** Familiarize with common asserts: `Assert.AreEqual`, `Assert.IsTrue`, `Assert.IsFalse`, `Assert.IsNotNull`, `Assert.Throws` (to check an exception is thrown), etc. These are the mechanisms to validate outcomes. NUnit will mark the test failed if an assertion fails.
- **Organize tests** similar to how code is organized. If you have a class `SensorService`, you might have `SensorServiceTests` with multiple [Test] methods each targeting a specific aspect of `SensorService` (e.g., `GetReading_ReturnsLatestValue`, `GetReading_Throws_WhenNotInitialized`, etc.). Name tests clearly — think of them as specifications of behavior.

**Resources:**

- **(Free)** *Microsoft Learn: Unit testing with NUnit* – Microsoft has an interactive tutorial **“Unit testing C# with NUnit and .NET Core”** ([Unit testing C# with NUnit and .NET Core - .NET | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-nunit#:~:text=This%20tutorial%20takes%20you%20through,instructions%2C%20see%20Samples%20and%20Tutorials)). It walks you through creating a solution with a class library and a test project, writing some sample functions and tests for them. It’s a great hands-on introduction if you haven’t written tests in .NET before. It also covers using the `dotnet test` CLI and some aspects of NUnit like `[TestFixture]` and `[Test]`.  
- **(Free)** *NUnit Documentation:* The official NUnit docs (on docs.nunit.org) detail all the attributes and features. There’s a quick-start that shows a basic example. It’s useful to skim the **Assertions** part of the docs to know what kinds of checks you can do. Also, read about **Constraint Model** of NUnit (fluent assertions like `Assert.That(x, Is.EqualTo(y))`) which you may encounter in team’s tests.  
- **(Free)** *Blog/Article – “NUnit Testing Tutorial”:* There are blog posts (like on Infragistics or LambdaTest) that give a complete rundown of NUnit with examples ([Getting Started With .NET Unit Testing Using NUnit - Infragistics](https://www.infragistics.com/blogs/net-unit-testing-using-nunit/#:~:text=Getting%20Started%20With%20,project%20%C2%B7%20Creating%20Test)). For instance, the Infragistics blog by Dhananjay Kumar (Feb 2025) is a good read ([Getting Started With .NET Unit Testing Using NUnit](https://www.infragistics.com/blogs/net-unit-testing-using-nunit/#:~:text=Automated%20unit%20tests%20while%20developing,code%20for%20different%20input%20sets)) as it demonstrates creating a calculator class, writing tests, and using Test Explorer. This mirrors what you will do, just with different classes.  
- **(Paid)** *Pluralsight – “Unit Testing in C#” courses:* Pluralsight has a number of courses on unit testing (some using MS Test, some NUnit, some xUnit). Even a general one like “Unit Testing Fundamentals” can be useful to understand how to structure tests, what to test, etc. Additionally, there are courses on **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** if you’re interested in that methodology (writing tests before implementation).  
- **(Free)** *Moq library (for mocking):* At some point, especially with hardware interaction, you might need to simulate external dependencies. Moq is a popular free library to create fake implementations at runtime. While not strictly required to start, keep it in mind. There are tutorials on using Moq with NUnit if needed (e.g., “Using Moq in NUnit to test” on DMC’s blog as seen in related posts).

**Hands-On:** Write tests for the practice projects you built. For example, if you have a ViewModel that adds contacts, write a test that when you execute `AddContactCommand`, the contact appears in the list. This might involve faking any services or just calling the underlying method if the command handler calls a method. Another example: if you created a `SensorDataProcessor` class that computes something, write tests for it with sample inputs. If you haven’t got a ready piece to test, try a kata or simple problem – e.g., write a small class to determine if a number is prime, then write NUnit tests for it (this is actually the example in the Microsoft tutorial). This lets you practice the mechanics of setting up a test project and running tests.  

Make sure to integrate test running into your routine: run tests via Visual Studio or `dotnet test` after making changes. This will eventually mirror how you run the real project’s test suite to ensure nothing broke. If the team uses a CI pipeline, your tests will also run there, so by running them locally first, you preempt CI failures.

**Milestone:** *Be able to confidently write and run unit tests for new code you develop.* In the team setting, this means if you implement a new feature or fix a bug, you also add the appropriate tests and ensure existing tests still pass. The outcome is that you treat the test project as an integral part of the solution, not an afterthought. When you fix a bug, you might even add a test that would have caught it, to prevent regression. Reaching this level means you’ve embraced the practice of unit testing. It also gives you the skill to evaluate the project’s current tests – reading them can often clarify how certain components are supposed to behave (tests serve as documentation too).

## 9. Working with NuGet Packages and Internal Libraries

The project you’re joining uses internal NuGet packages, especially for interfacing with custom hardware and sensors. In enterprise projects, it’s common to factor out certain components into separate libraries and distribute them as NuGet packages (even if only used internally). Thus, understanding **NuGet** – the package manager for .NET – and how to work with custom package sources is important.

**What is NuGet?** – *“NuGet is the package manager for .NET. It enables developers to create, share, and consume useful .NET libraries.”* ([NuGet documentation | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/#:~:text=NuGet%20documentation)). A NuGet **package** (.nupkg file) is basically a zip containing compiled DLLs and metadata. Developers publish packages to a feed (like nuget.org or a private server), and other projects can reference those packages to use the functionality without having the source. Using NuGet has the benefit of modularizing code and handling dependency versions.

**Consuming NuGet Packages:** In Visual Studio, you typically add a NuGet package via the *NuGet Package Manager*. This can be done through the GUI (right-click References > Manage NuGet Packages) or through the Package Manager Console (`Install-Package SomePackage`) or `dotnet CLI` (`dotnet add package SomePackage`). When you install a package, it adds references to the included DLLs and downloads them to a global or local package cache. In a .NET 6 project with PackageReference, the packages are listed in the .csproj file (you’ll see `<PackageReference Include="PackageName" Version="X.Y.Z" />` entries).

For **internal packages**, your team likely has a **private NuGet feed**. This could be hosted on GitLab (GitLab has a Package Registry that supports NuGet feeds), Azure Artifacts, Artifactory, or even a simple network folder. Instead of nuget.org, the source URL will be different.

- To use a private feed, you usually have to add its URL to your NuGet configuration. In Visual Studio, you can add a package source under Options > NuGet Package Manager > Package Sources. If authentication is needed (likely for an internal feed), you might need to provide credentials (for GitLab’s feed, typically a personal access token is used). Once the source is added, VS can list and install packages from it.
- If the internal libraries are already installed in the project, you might not have to add them manually; just restore packages. Ensure you have access: you might need to be given a token or permissions for the feed. Check the project’s documentation or ask a team member for the feed setup instructions.
- **Managing versions:** Learn how to update a NuGet package to a newer version using the NuGet UI or CLI. Also know how to check the installed version (in VS’s Packages UI or the project file). If a library update causes issues, sometimes you might need to roll back to a previous version – so understanding how to specify versions is useful.
- **Troubleshooting NuGet:** If a package fails to restore (e.g., you get a compile error that a namespace is missing), it could be due to an incorrect feed configuration or missing credentials. Knowing to run `dotnet restore` with verbosity or looking at VS’s Output (NuGet) can help pinpoint the issue. For internal feeds, network or auth issues are common initial hiccups.

**Private/Internal NuGet Feeds:** Many organizations do not publish proprietary libraries to the public. Instead, they host them privately. NuGet fully supports this scenario:
- *“Instead of making packages publicly available, you might want to release packages to only a limited audience, such as your organization… For all such purposes, NuGet supports setting up private package sources.”* ([Overview of Hosting Your Own NuGet Feeds | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/hosting-packages/overview#:~:text=Instead%20of%20making%20packages%20publicly,org)). The methods include simple file shares, private servers, or built-in services like GitLab’s Package Registry or Azure DevOps Artifacts.
- In your case, since the focus is GitLab, it’s likely the internal libraries are hosted on **GitLab Package Registry**. Each GitLab project can act as a NuGet feed (URL typically looks like `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<ProjectID>/packages/nuget/index.json` for project-level).
- Using GitLab’s NuGet feed will require creating a personal access token with `read_package_registry` scope and adding the source in NuGet’s config with that token (the GitLab docs detail this process ([NuGet packages in the package registry | GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/nuget_repository/#:~:text=To%20publish%20and%20install%20packages,a%20source%20for%20your%20packages)) ([NuGet packages in the package registry | GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/nuget_repository/#:~:text=,on%20your%20group%E2%80%99s%20home%20page))). Once set up, using the packages is the same as any other NuGet.

**Working with Internal Libraries:** Besides just installing them, as a developer you should:
- Read any documentation or API reference they have. Perhaps the team has internal docs for how to use the sensor interface library (if not, you might have to read the code via decompiling or if they provided source).
- Understand the update cycle: Are these packages updated frequently? Does the team commit changes to them or are they maintained by another team? If you need to modify something in an internal library, the process might be to update that library’s code (in its own repo), publish a new NuGet version, and then update the main app to that version.
- **NuGet Package Versioning:** Usually versioning follows semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch). An internal library might be at v1.x or similar. If your app needs a new capability in the library, you might coordinate to bump the version. Always ensure the main app is referencing the correct version (some companies even lock versions via a global packages.props). Don’t accidentally update a package version without coordination.

**Resources:**

- **(Free)** *NuGet Documentation (Microsoft):* The official docs cover everything from installation to creating packages. Key pages: **“Install and use a package (Visual Studio)”** (step-by-step for adding a NuGet package to a project), and **“Publish to a private feed”** (explains how to set up and publish to various private sources). While you might not publish packages yourself initially, understanding that process can help, especially if you ever need to create a NuGet (maybe for a utility or if contributing to the internal libraries).  
- **(Free)** *GitLab Package Registry Docs:* GitLab’s documentation on **NuGet packages in the package registry** ([NuGet packages in the package registry | GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/nuget_repository/#:~:text=Publish%20NuGet%20packages%20in%20your,use%20them%20as%20a%20dependency)) will be directly relevant if that’s what you use. It covers how to authenticate and set up the feed. They have examples for adding the source via Visual Studio or nuget.config ([NuGet packages in the package registry | GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/nuget_repository/#:~:text=Add%20the%20package%20registry%20as,a%20source%20for%20NuGet%20packages)) ([NuGet packages in the package registry | GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/nuget_repository/#:~:text=You%20can%20now%20add%20a,new%20source%20to%20NuGet%20with)). Review this to ensure you have the feed properly configured.  
- **(Free)** *NuGet Config and CLI:* Learn about the `nuget.config` file. Sometimes projects include a `NuGet.config` in the repository to configure package sources for all developers. Check if your project has one (it would list the internal feed URL). If not, you’ll add it in your global config. The NuGet docs on `nuget.config` and `dotnet nuget add source` CLI command are useful if you need to script it.  
- **(Free)** *Article – “Managing NuGet Packages for Enterprise”:* There are blog posts or Medium articles on best practices for using NuGet in an enterprise setting. They might discuss strategies like internal package repositories, version pinning, etc. While not critical, reading one could give you insight into why things are set up a certain way in your team (for example, they might have a mirror of nuget.org to cache packages, or strict version approvals).
- **(Paid)** *No dedicated paid resource needed specifically for NuGet.* The free docs are usually enough. If anything, some courses on DevOps or .NET might include a module on package management, but you likely won’t need a full course on NuGet.

**Hands-On:** To solidify your understanding, try creating a simple NuGet package yourself (just for learning). For instance, make a small class library (could be something like “MathUtils” with a couple of methods), and then use `dotnet pack` to create a NuGet package. Then create another project and install that package (possibly by setting up a local folder as a NuGet source). This mini exercise will demystify the package creation and consumption process: you’ll see how your library’s version and metadata appear in Visual Studio, how updating the package changes the consumed code, etc. You can even simulate a private feed by using a local folder or a private GitHub feed. Though optional, this experience can help when dealing with the real internal packages (especially if you ever need to fix and republish one).

**Milestone:** *Be capable of managing NuGet dependencies in the project.* This means you can add a new NuGet package (from public or internal source) if needed, update existing ones responsibly, and troubleshoot package restore issues. In context of your project, it ensures you can work with those internal sensor/hardware libraries smoothly – for example, if someone says “Use `SensorToolkit 2.0.0` package for the new device integration,” you’d know how to get that version and update the references. It also implies you understand where that library fits in: e.g., you won’t try to edit the code of a NuGet package directly in your solution (since it’s external), but you know how to call its APIs and maybe read its release notes or documentation for guidance.

## 10. Putting It All Together – Capstone Project & Continued Learning

To reinforce everything, it’s valuable to undertake a **mini-project** that ties together C#, WPF, MVVM/Prism, Git, testing, and NuGet usage. This can be a scaled-down version of what your real project might be. Since your domain involves hardware sensors, you could simulate that:

**Capstone Idea:** *“Environmental Monitor” Desktop App* – Imagine an app that monitors temperature and humidity from sensors:
- **Description:** The app has a main window (shell) with two regions: one for navigation (a menu or buttons to switch between views) and one for content. There are two views: **DashboardView** (displays current readings and perhaps graphs/trends) and **SettingsView** (to configure thresholds, etc.). The data comes from a sensor service that in real life would interface with hardware, but for this project, you’ll simulate it (e.g., a service that generates random data or reads from a file).
- **Technical Implementation:** Use Prism to set up the shell and navigation. Have a `SensorModule` that registers `ISensorService` and provides `DashboardView` and `SettingsView`. The `SensorService` simulation can be a simple class that generates data periodically (maybe use a `Timer` or just generate on request). The DashboardViewModel subscribes to updates (via an event or polling) and updates properties (with INotifyPropertyChanged) that the DashboardView binds to (like `CurrentTemperature`). The SettingsViewModel could allow the user to set a warning threshold which the DashboardViewModel uses to, say, change color if temp exceeds threshold.
- Use **DelegateCommand** for any button actions (e.g., a refresh button).
- Integrate an **internal NuGet**: you could package your sensor service interface as a NuGet (just for simulation, or use any existing internal-like NuGet such as a fictitious “HardwareSDK” with dummy methods). Or use a real public NuGet like LiveCharts for plotting (to practice adding a NuGet). 
- Write a few **unit tests**: e.g., test that the SensorService returns values in expected range, test that DashboardViewModel raises an alert flag when threshold is exceeded, etc., using NUnit.
- Put the project under **Git source control** (even locally or on a private GitLab repo). Practice the full workflow: create an issue “Implement threshold alert”, branch, commit changes, merge request, etc., even if you are the only one working – it reinforces the habit.

This capstone will force you to apply each skill in concert, which is exactly what working on the real project will be like. It’s okay if it’s not perfect or fully complete; the goal is to identify any weak spots where you need further clarification.

**Beyond the Plan – Continued Learning:** Software development is an ever-learning field. Even after going through all the above, you will continue to encounter new concepts or deeper levels of understanding:
- **Advanced C# and .NET:** Explore more advanced C# features as needed (async/await for concurrency – perhaps your sensor reading is on a background thread? –, `using` statements and IDisposable for resource management, etc.). “C# in Depth” will be a great companion as you deepen knowledge.
- **Design Patterns:** MVVM is one pattern; you might also benefit from understanding others like Dependency Injection (which you’re using via Prism), Repository pattern (if dealing with data storage), etc. As a PhD, you might appreciate the formalism of patterns and principles (SOLID principles are widely observed in C# architectures).
- **Community and Documentation:** Keep the official docs handy (Microsoft’s WPF and .NET docs, Prism docs, NUnit docs). Stack Overflow is your friend for specific “how do I…?” questions. Microsoft’s Q&A forums and the .NET Foundation Discord are also places to ask questions if stuck.
- **Team-Specific Practices:** Finally, adapt to your team’s specific conventions. They might have a coding style guide, specific branch naming scheme, or custom tools (maybe a code generator, or an internal analyzer). Pay attention during code reviews to align with their best practices. 

By following this learning guide and utilizing the resources at each step, you will build a strong foundation in modern .NET desktop development. The combination of theoretical understanding and hands-on practice will prepare you to confidently contribute to your WPF Prism application. Remember to take it step by step, and don’t hesitate to revisit topics as needed – each layer (C#, then WPF, then MVVM, then Prism, etc.) will make more sense as you apply it in context. Good luck with your journey, and enjoy the process of leveling up your development skills!
